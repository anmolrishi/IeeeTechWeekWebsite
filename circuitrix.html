            <p>All electronics lovers, get ready for the rollercoaster ride of analog and digital circuits as CIRCUITRIX is back with more challenging and mind twisting questions!<br />First round: Online Screening Round <br />The first round comprises of 25 questions. It will be an online round of 60 minutes. The top 7 teams scoring the highest marks will get selected for further rounds. In case, teams have a tie, the team with earlier response submission will be selected.<br />Second round: Software Simulation Round<br />The teams selected will be provided with problem statements. The teams will have to solve the given problems, and realize the circuits with all the components being used along with their exact values. After the circuit realization the simulation will be done on any of the software like LTSpice/PSpice/ TinaPro/Proteus. Top 3 teams will get selected.<br />Third round: Hardware Implementation Round<br />The teams selected will be provided with problem statements. The teams will have to solve the given problems, and realize the circuits with all the components being used along with their exact values. The circuit implementation will be done on hardware using breadboards and other components.</p>
            <p>RULES AND REGULATIONS<br />General Rules<br />A team of maximum 4 participants is allowed. Cross-college teams are also allowed. Participants should be undergraduate students of any year. <br />Use of internet or any other unfair material, in any case, is not allowed and will result in disqualification of the team.<br />First round: Online Screening Round<br />Each correct answer will be awarded +4 marks, incorrect answers will be awarded with -1 marks and unattempt questions will be awarded 0 marks. <br />After the allotted time is over, the answers marked will get submitted as response automatically (if not submitted before).<br />Once the question is attempted, the response cannot be changed. Though the teams will be allowed to go back to the questions, which are unattempted. <br />Second round: Software Simulation Round<br />The teams cannot simulate and check their circuits before the submission. Any team found, doing so, will be disqualified.<br />Third round:<br />The teams cannot give power supply and check their implementation. Any team found, doing so, will be disqualified.</p>
            <p>NOTE: First round will be an online round (date for the round will be revealed soon) and the subsequent rounds will be held in college premises. Both the second and third rounds will be an hour each and the teams will be given a break of 1 hour in between.</p>
