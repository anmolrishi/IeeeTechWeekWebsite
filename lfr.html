            <p>We all start, but a few finish, and the ones who finish are the ones who win! Make your<br />bots follow the track, give them the intelligence to race against the time and reach the<br />finish line! Gear up, hold your chairs tight and devote your time into making your own<br />robot. Master it on &lsquo;the day&rsquo; and win exciting prizes!<br />The objective is to make your own line following robot which can complete custom<br />tracks accurately in the shortest amount of time. So get into full engineering mode and<br />build the robot to beat them all!<br />Team Size<br />1-4 undergraduate students. Cross college teams ARE allowed.<br />Rules<br />1. The competition is open to everyone studying in College/University across India,<br />irrespective of his or her branch and year of study<br />2. The maximum number of participants in a team is 4.<br />3. The robot must be fully autonomous.<br />4. The event consists of only one round.The participants will be competing on a<br />track of width 1 inch on a flex board.The line follower has to follow the black path<br />from start till end to successfully complete the task.<br />5. Each team will be given a maximum time of 10 minutes to complete the task.<br />6. The track may have spaces,crossover of lines and in both the cases the robot<br />must be designed to move in straight direction.<br />7. In case the robot goes off track and is unable to come on track on its own then<br />the team will be allowed to only pick or move the robot with their hands and place<br />it on the track again. Every hand touch will result in a penalty.<br />8. Teams have to report on track with their robot when called. If the team is not<br />prepared or is absent, then they will be deemed to be disqualified. No next turn<br />will be given.<br />9. The decisions of officials regarding the rules and the conduct of event shall be<br />final.</p>
